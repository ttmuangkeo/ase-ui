# LayerDraw 2.0

LayerDraw 2.0 is a Rails 5 application using Webpacker for its VueJS front end.

## Development

Clone this repository locally.

1. Run `bundle install` for Ruby Gems.
2. Run `yarn install` for Vue packages. (Note that Rails prefers Yarn over NPM as it creates a yarn.lock file from the jump).
3. Start rails by running `rails s`.
4. In a separate terminal, run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` - if you want faster Vue compiling...which you will...
5. Write code :)
